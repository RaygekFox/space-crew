## Step 2: Game Loop Implementation ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented game loop using Socket.io's background tasks:
   - Created a self-scheduling background task for the game loop
   - Set 100ms interval between ticks (10 ticks per second)
   - Added proper timing control to maintain consistent tick rate

2. Added tick counter:
   - Counter increments with each tick
   - Updates displayed in real-time to all connected clients
   - Game status changes when ticks start

3. Enhanced server-client communication:
   - Added tick_update event for broadcasting tick count
   - New clients receive current tick count on connection
   - Game loop starts automatically when first client connects

### Technical Details
- Game loop runs as a background task in the Socket.io event loop
- Uses time.sleep() to maintain consistent 100ms tick intervals
- The game state is maintained on the server and broadcast to all clients
- Game loop starts only once, when the first client connects

## Step 3: Pause/Play Functionality ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. Added secondary "counted ticks" variable:
   - New counter that increments alongside server ticks
   - Can be paused/resumed independently
   - Server ticks continue to run uninterrupted

2. Implemented pause/play button:
   - Added toggle button in the UI
   - Button updates its text and style based on current state
   - All connected clients see the same state

3. Enhanced client-server communication:
   - Added new socket event for toggling the counting state
   - State changes are broadcast to all connected clients
   - New clients receive the current counting state on connection

### Technical Details
- Main server tick counter continues to run regardless of pause state
- Added 'counting_enabled' flag to control secondary counter
- All state changes synchronize across all connected clients
- Button updates visually to indicate current state (red for pause, green for play)

## Step 4: Game Logic Implementation ✅

   - Temperature threshold monitoring (t, t_l, t_r, t_c)
   - Safe launch grace period (10 ticks)

4. Enhanced user interface:
   - Added visual display for all game parameters
   - Implemented game over screen with restart functionality
   - Created responsive parameter layout

5. Improved server-client communication:

   - Modified crash detection to allow for stationary state on ground
   - Ensures proper takeoff physics

### Technical Details

- Physical calculations use standard kinematic equations
- All parameters have appropriate min/max constraints
- Randomization added for frequency drift (mu_in)
